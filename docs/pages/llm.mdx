# LLM APIs

We support OpenAI and Anthropic APIs out of the box, though Anthropic models tend to work better with XML data.

## Anthropic


<Code>
<Python>
```python
from xmlai.llm import anthropic_prompt

prompt = anthropic_prompt(
    {
        "question": "what is the answer to the ultimate question of life?",
        "reference": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy",
    },
    response_root_tag="answer",
)

completion = anthropic.completions.create(
    model="claude-instant-1",
    max_tokens_to_sample=300,
    temperature=0.1,
    **prompt,
)

completion.completion # 42
```
</Python>
<Typescript>
```typescript
import { anthropicPrompt } from "xmlai/llm";

const prompt = anthropicPrompt(
    {
        question: "what is the answer to the ultimate question of life?",
        reference: "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy",
    },
    response_root_tag="answer"
);

const completion = await anthropic.completions.create({
    model: "claude-instant-1",
    max_tokens_to_sample: 300,
    temperature: 0.1,
    ...prompt,
});

completion.completion // 42
```
</Typescript>
</Code>

The generated prompts look like this:
```json
{
   "prompt":"\n\nHuman:<question>what is the answer to the ultimate question of life?</question>
   <reference>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</reference>\n\nAssistant:<answer>",
   "stop_sequences":[
      "</answer>"
   ]
}
```

Note that we feed the opening tag to the beginning of the assistant's response! This combined with the closing tag as the stop token almost always ensures that the response is valid XML.


## Why another prompting library?
Anthropic's LLM Claude is trained on lots and lots of XML data. It is quite good at following XML schemas. In fact at the [Anthropic Hackathon](https://twitter.com/sauhaarda/status/1685892051043508224?s=20), the prompting workshop specifically presented some extra tips on how to get the best out of Claude when it comes to XML. I incorporated those tricks into this library to make it easier for others to take advantage of.

Also, [the regex for dealing with XML streams](https://github.com/raunakdoesdev/xmlai/blob/9a558d855e6b4e64f933599a249a0864c41eb273/python/src/xmlai/__init__.py#L17C41-L17C41) is surprisingly grotesque. I figured I'd limit the monstrosity to one codebase where it can be tested and maintained.


## Limitations
XML is primarily intended for use with string data. If you are needing data to be outputted numerically or in another format, you will need to implement additional prompting and processing on top of XML AI.
